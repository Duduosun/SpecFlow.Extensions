         * 
         * I get it. Null and DBNull are not the same and are two completely different concepts.
         * That being said, I don't want test code to constantly check / handle this nuance every time.
         * To that end, null is null (invalid or nothing) which the test code will generally handle the same way
         *  (with rare exception, of course).
