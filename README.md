# SpecFlow.Extensions
extensions for SpecFlow and Selenium

This project will be a container for the SpecFlow / Selenium extension code that I develop while
using said software tools. Too often I find myself looking up webdriver code on the internet and I'd
like to keep everything I use in one convenient and portable library (for future use of course).

# Framework

For starters, this is not a "plug-and-play one size fits all" test framework. This is a "modify and 
integrate into your test environment" test framework. That said, you'll most likely have to create
and fill in code to get portions of SpecFlow.Extensions to work for your particular situation. It is,
however, IMHO, a good place to start. I prefer to consider it a toolkit.
